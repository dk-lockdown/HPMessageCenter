If your issue is focused more on 'how do I do this?' rather than 'this is a broken functionality', then either ask on our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/sweetalert2/lobby) or submit it to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) instead of GitHub, and make sure you add the [`sweetalert`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sweetalert) tag to the question.
